Forking the plugin / Making it your own
--------------------

We have created a few dashboards for you to use right out of the box.  However if you'd like to take this plugin and customize it for your own specific needs you can do the following:

1. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) | [Download the code](https://github.com/nickfloyd/newrelic-perfmon-plugin/archive/master.zip)
2. Change the agent_guid found in `perfmon_plugins_multithread.rb` to your own custom GUID (see the [docs](https://newrelic.com/docs/plugin-dev/the-parts-of-a-plugin#guid) for more information)
3. Follow the instructions above - **Instructions for running the Plugin**

Notes / Tips
--------------------

* Set "debug: true" in newrelic_plugin.yml to see the metrics logged to stdout instead of sending them to New Relic.
* Make sure that you set your license key in `config\newrelic_plugin.yml` if you're not seeing the plugin show up in your dashboard.
* You can add or remove counters by editing the `perfmon_metrics.rb` file.
